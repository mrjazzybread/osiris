(** *Closing a match-success postcondition while preserving the guard *)

(* When [solve_pure_cpattern] drives the [cpattern]/[pattern] machinery on
   an Iris match, the per-branch success postcondition [Hη : env → Prop] is
   an evar threaded from [deep_handle_cons] down to the matching leaf, where
   it surfaces as a goal [?Hη δ] ([δ] the matched environment).

   [apply eq_refl] pins [?Hη := λ η', η' = δ], which drops the guard for a
   constructor pattern: matching leaves the bound variables and a guard
   equation [c = Ctor …] in context, and a bare environment equality throws
   them away, leaving the branch body unconstrained by the matched case.

   [close_success before] instead closes over the hypotheses introduced
   since [before]:
     [λ η', ∃ <delta vars>, <delta guards> ∧ η' = δ],
   so the branch body goal carries the matched-constructor equation. With no
   such hypotheses it degenerates to [λ η', η' = δ]. *)

(* [subst_var id t c] replaces every occurrence of the local variable [id] in

(* [imp_match] applies the [imp_EMatch] rule to a goal of the form
   [EWP eval η (EMatch e bs) ...].  It dispatches two subgoals:
     1. the scrutinee expression [EWP eval η e {{ Φ' }}], which [imp_step]
        is tried on automatically;
     2. the eval_branches continuation, where [simple_intros] peels off the
        [∀ a, Φ' a -∗ ▷] prefix and then [imp_branches] automatically
        processes all pattern branches.
   Optionally, the intermediate type [A'] of the scrutinee can be given as
   an argument.  If omitted, [A'] and its [Encode] instance are left as
   evars, to be resolved by the scrutinee subgoal. *)

From osiris.proofmode Require Import imp_tactics.

(* [phi], when given, fixes the scrutinee's postcondition [Φ'] up front
   (via [imp_EMatch (Φ':=phi)]). Needed whenever the continuation proof
   picks its own witnesses for an existential [Φ']: [iExists] cannot act
   on an evar-headed goal. Mirrors the [imp_store' l $! Φ] convention. *)
