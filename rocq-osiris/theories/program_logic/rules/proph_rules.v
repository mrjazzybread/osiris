(** * Reasoning rules for prophecy variables. *)

(* A prophecy variable is a name to which the logic can attach a claim
   about the future of the execution. [proph p pvs] says that the
   remaining resolutions of [p], in order, will be [pvs]. That is a claim
   about what has not happened yet, and the only thing that makes it
   sound is the observation trace threaded through [state_interp]: the
   step relation records every resolution, and adequacy quantifies over an
   execution together with the trace it produces. See
   [osiris_proph_interp] in ewp.v.

   The two rules below are the whole interface. [ewp_new_proph] mints a
   prediction; [ewp_resolve] cashes one in. *)

  (** ** Resolution. *)

  (* [Stop (CResolve c) (x, p, v) k] performs the system call [c x] and
     resolves [p] with the pair of its result and [v], in one step. This is
     HeapLang's [wp_resolve] in Osiris's terms.

     The first premise is atomicity, and it is not a technicality: a call
     that steps to a whole computation rather than to a result has no
     result for the resolution to record. It holds for exactly the four
     operations [eval] admits under a resolution: load, exchange,
     compare-and-set, fetch-and-add. *)
