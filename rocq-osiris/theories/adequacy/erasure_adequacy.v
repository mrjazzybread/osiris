       (∀ o, π !! ι = Some (inject2 o) → Φ o)) →
    (* then the program with its annotations removed is safe from [σe], emits
       nothing, and returns the erasure of a result of the annotated one. *)

(* Whether a call is stuck depends only on its code, not on its argument,
   continuation, store or pool: [perform] is stuck; a resolution steps at the
   pool level only if its wrapped call reduces to an outcome; a [join] is
   waiting, which is [not_stuck]'s third disjunct; everything else steps.
   This is what lets the simulation transfer progress. *)
