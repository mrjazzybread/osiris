(* Graph-theoretic facts about growing [F] by one edge. These feed the
   linking case of the CAS lemma [uf_cas_fupd] below. *)

(* [F]'s edges strictly decrease the identifier. This rules out cycles
   even when the target of a freshly-installed edge is no longer a root
   by the time the edge goes in. *)

Definition id_bounded (M : gmap elem Z) (F : elem → elem → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ w z iw iz, F w z → M !! w = Some iw → M !! z = Some iz → (iz < iw)%Z.

(* Following [F]-edges strictly decreases the identifier, given
   [id_bounded]: an easy induction along the path, confining each
   intermediate vertex into [dom M] (hence giving it an id to compare)
   via [DSF]'s own [Confined] component. *)

Lemma path_id_decrease (M : gmap elem Z) (F : elem -> elem -> Prop) :
  DSF F (dom M) ->
  id_bounded M F ->
  forall w z, rtc F w z -> forall iw iz, M !! w = Some iw -> M !! z = Some iz -> w <> z -> (iz < iw)%Z.
Proof.
  intros Hdsf Hid w z Hpath.
  induction Hpath as [w | w w' z HF Hpath IH]; intros iw iz Hiw Hiz Hne.
  - contradiction.

(* The generalized edge-addition lemma the linking CAS actually needs:
   unlike [UnionFind03Link.is_dsf_link], this does NOT require the new
   edge's target [y'] to currently be a root — only that [y']'s id is
   strictly below [a]'s (exactly the [x.id > y.id] branch guard). This
   matters because [y'] is a STALE [findc]-time snapshot: nothing
   re-checks its root-status right before the CAS that installs the edge,
   so a concurrent [union] could in principle have already merged [y']
   away by then. Soundness (no cycle, [Defined Repr] still holds) comes
   from [id_bounded] instead: if [y']'s current representative [ry] were
   ever equal to [a], the (necessarily nonempty, since [y' ≠ a]) path
   [y' ->* a] would force [id a < id y'] via [path_id_decrease],
   contradicting the branch guard [id y' < id a] directly — so [ry ≠ a],
   and [w]'s new representative (for any [w] that used to route to [a])
   is simply [ry] itself, reached via [w ->* a -> y' ->* ry]. *)
