   one instant refutes root-ness at every later one, against whatever
   [cell_own] the invariant holds now.

   This is what the [false] case of [eq] turns on: it must know, while
   still inside [findc y], how a later read of [x.content] will turn out.

   [linked]'s negation is a resource in the invariant, not a proposition a
