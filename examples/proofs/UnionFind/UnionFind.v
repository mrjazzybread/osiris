(* The predicate [Mem ...] relates the mathematical graph encoded by [D/F/V]
   and the memory encoded by the finite map [M]. In short,
    1. [M]'s domain is exactly [D] (in particular, no entries outside [D] —
       this is what lets us derive that a freshly-allocated vertex is not in
       [D] from the fact that it cannot already have an [M] entry);
    2. the links in [M] coincide with the links in [F];
    3. the data stored at a root in [M] agrees with [V]. (We don't track the
       rank's value at all, having dropped the complexity analysis it was
       for; the actual rank field stored in memory is existentially
       quantified away in [rec_repr] below.)
   [Mem] never inspects the record-location component of a [vcell]: where a
   vertex's record block lives is a purely heap-level matter. *)

(* [rec_repr lr lc] owns the record block at [lr] backing a vertex whose

   lr lc] for each entry [x ↦ (lr, lc)] of [M]. Crucially the record
   locations are part of [M] rather than existentially hidden per entry:
   since [find] only ever mutates record *fields* (never a content cell,
   and never reallocating a record), the record-location skeleton [skel M]
   below is an invariant of [find], so [x]'s own record is recoverable by
   name after the recursive call. This is what lets [find] recurse on the
   *whole* structure — no framing of [x]'s resources out of the recursion,
   and no reachable-set restriction. *)

(* Module-level specification. *)

(* [__main] is the whole [UnionFindBasic] structure. Walking down its items
   with the [imp_sitems_*] rules turns the per-function lemmas above into a
   single statement about the module: evaluating it produces an environment
   in which every exported name is bound to a value satisfying its
   specification.

   The [let rec find] item is where [imp_sitems_letrec_iSpec] earns its keep.
   The plain [imp_sitems_letrec] rule would ask us to establish [find]'s
   specification for the recursive closure out of thin air; the Löb variant
   instead hands [find_spec_inductive] the very hypothesis it needs — that
   the closure being defined already satisfies [find_spec']. *)

(* [eq] and [merge] are evaluated and bound, but are given no specification
   here — they still have to be walked over, since the items after them
   extend the same environment.

   [merge] takes a user function as an argument and has no proof yet.
   [eq]'s body is [x == y || find x == find y]: the two [find] calls sit on
   either side of a [==], which [eval] compiles to an *unordered* [par], and
   the only [par] rules available in the impure logic ([imp_bind_par],
   [imp_bind_par_frac]) split the resources between the two operands. An
   exclusive [UF D R V] cannot be split that way, so specifying [eq] first
   needs a sequential (or both-orders) rule for [par] in the program logic,
   analogous to [pure_par_seq] in the pure logic. *)

  {["make"; "find"; "is_representative"; "eq"; "get"; "set"; "union"; "merge"]}.

(* Resolve the name "find" in the current environment, which binds it under
   an arbitrary number of later (differently named) bindings. This is the
   [in_env] premise that [get_proof], [set_proof] and [union_proof] expect,
   and it is what [imp_path] consumes at the recursive call sites. *)
